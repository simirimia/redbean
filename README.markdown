THIS REPOSITORY IS DEPRECATED
=============================

The whole point of it was to have a composer-enabled version of RedBeanPHP. In the meantime Gabor accepted the neccessary changes in the main repository and so there is no need for a separate fork anymore.

Please change your composer.josn files to use the main repository (which is https://github.com/gabordemooij/redbean):
```json
{
    "require": {
        "gabordemooij/redbean": "dev-master"
    }
}
```
